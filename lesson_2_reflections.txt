What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	It creates an empty git repository. You do it so you can later add files to it that you need to commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is where you want to keep all your files that need to be tracked by git eventually. The working directory is where you are currently. Staging area is where you make all the changes before you commit. It adds value because it separates the committed files fron the non comitteded files. ( I think !?)
